## How to Develop
We use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) as our static site generator, so check its documentation for a general overview.

Specifically for this repo you need to have the [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/download) installed.
Furthermore, you need to configure to use flakes and nix commands, by adding `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf`.

Afterwards you should be able to run a live-reload server locally as follows:
```bash
nix develop --command zola serve
```
